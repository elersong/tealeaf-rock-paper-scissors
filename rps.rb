# Pseudocode Algorithm
# 1. Prompt user to select one of three choices (R, P, or S)
# 2. Randomly select one of the three choices by the computer
# 3. Compare based on the logic that 
#     =>  P beats R but not S
#     =>  R beats S but not P
#     =>  S beats P but not R
# 4. Declare the winner and prompt to play again or end
